Problem Description

Per recently learned about palindromes. Now he wants to tell us about it and also has more awesome scientific news to share with us.
¡°A palindrome is a word that is the same no matter whether you read it backward or forward¡±, Per recently said in an interview. He continued: ¡°For example, ¡®add¡¯ is not a palindrome, because reading it backwards gives ¡®dda¡¯ and it¡¯s actually not the same thing, you see.
However, if we reorder the letters of the word, we can actually get a palindrome. Hence, we say that ¡®add¡¯ is a Peragram, because it is an anagram of a palindrome¡±.
Per gives us a more formal definition of Peragrams: ¡°Like I said, if a word is an anagram of at least one palindrome, we call it a Peragram. And recall that an anagram of a word w contains exactly the same letters as w, possibly in a different order.¡±

Given a string, find the minimum number of letters you have to remove from it, so that the string becomes a Peragram. 

Input
Multiple cases. Each case consists of a string on a single line. The string will contain at least 1 and at most 1000 characters. The string will only contain lowercase letters ¡®a¡¯-¡®z¡¯.

Output
Output should consist of a single integer on a single line, the minimum number of characters that have to be removed from the string to make it a Peragram.

Sample Input
abc 
aab

Sample Output
2
