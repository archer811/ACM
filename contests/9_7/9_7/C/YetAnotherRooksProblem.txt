Problem Description
You have k rooks and an m x n board. The placement of rooks on the board is called correct if no rook is between two other rooks, horizontally or vertically.

Given m, n and k find the number of correct placements of rooks on the board. Since this number may be quite large, find it modulo 10003.
Input
Multiple cases. (< 25 cases)
Each case contains m, n and k (1 <= m,n <= 50, 1 <= k <= m*n).
Output
For each case print one number ¡ª the number of correct placements of k rooks on the m x n board modulo 10003.
